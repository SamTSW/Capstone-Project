# Executive Summary: Predicting Glaucoma Types

In this glaucoma prediction project, the primary goal is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the specific glaucoma type for individual patients. 
By achieving this, the aim is to enhance clinical decision-making, optimize treatment strategies, and improve patient outcomes.

## Problem Statement:

### 1.	Understanding Glaucoma:
- Glaucoma encompasses a group of eye diseases that can lead to vision loss and even blindness. It primarily affects the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain.
- The condition often develops silently, without noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Patients may remain unaware until significant vision loss occurs.

### 2.	Challenges in Diagnosing Glaucoma:
- Glaucoma diagnosis involves a multifaceted process, including various assessments (e.g., fundus imaging, family history, medical records, eye pressure, and visual acuity).
- The data required for accurate diagnosis is often dispersed across different sources, potentially leading to oversight of critical information.
- Identifying glaucoma suspects—patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) but no clinical signs—poses a significant challenge.

## Key Project Steps:
### 1.	Data Collection:
- The data is sourced from Kaggle: Glaucoma Detection Dataset.
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teamincribo/glaucoma-detection-dataset

### 2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization:
  - Mean Age: Patients’ average age is 54 years, suggesting that the risk of developing glaucoma increases from this age onward.
  - Cup-to-Disc Ratios: Similar ratios exist between diagnosed glaucoma and non-glaucoma cases. A large cup-to-disc ratio doesn’t necessarily indicate glaucoma.
  - Gender-Age Relationship: Females face a higher risk of glaucoma as they age.
  - Explore Relationships: Investigate the interplay between cup-to-disc ratio, intraocular pressure, and glaucoma.
  - Glaucoma Type Distribution: Analyze the prevalence of different glaucoma types.

### 3.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  - Address missing values to ensure data completeness.
  - Standardize formats for consistency.
  - Create relevant features capturing essential glaucoma-related information.

### 4.	Machine Learning Prediction:
   
The Random Forest Model has been chosen due to its advantages:
  -	Combining multiple trees to reduce overfitting.
  -	Providing feature importance scores.
  - Capturing complex relationships.

 The model aims to predict glaucoma types (e.g., primary open-angle, angle-closure, normal-tension) based on relevant clinical features.

## Conclusion:

The glaucoma prediction model achieved an overall accuracy of 80%, demonstrating its ability to correctly classify glaucoma types.
  
Key findings from the classification report:
- Precision: Ranges from 78% to 82% across different glaucoma types.
- Recall: Consistently high, indicating effective identification of true positive cases.
- F1-Score: Around 0.80 for all glaucoma categories, striking a balance between precision and recall.

 In summary, this model provides valuable insights for clinical decision-making, aiding in personalized glaucoma diagnosis and treatment planning.
